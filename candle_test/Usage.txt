Usage: candle_test <options>\nOptions:
    -a argfile        Read arguments from argfile. # is a comment character
    -b bitrate        
    -c device_channel 
    -f                pad usb packets to full packet size for better speed
                      (default off, firmware support on candle required
    -i canbus_id      only print frames from from these ids, multiples ok
    -n device_number  
    -p print_period   
    -r send_rate      (frames per second)
    -s canbus_id(hex) <byte(hex) byte ...> add this can frame to send list
    -t                turn on timestamp mode (default off)\n");

This test program was written to evaluate the performance of the
candle dll under Windows, but it may be useful in its own right. Examples:

candle_test -b 500000 -f -t

This will print out all packets on the canbus with the bit rate set to
500k bits per second.  Timestamp mode is turned on, and the program
will try and turn on the mode in the firmware that pads packets to 32
bytes for better performance.  If this mode isn't supported in the
firmware you should get an error.  Packets are printed out in columns:

TX rate RX rate Timestamp ID DLC Byte Byte Byte ...

candle_test -s 303 01 02 03 04 05 -i 240

This will get ready to send a canbus packet to an id of 0x303 with 5
data bytes of 0x01 0x02 0x03 0x04 0x05.  Each time you hit the "s" key
on the keyboard the packet will be sent.  Only canbus packets received
with an ID 0f 0x240 will be printed out.

candle_test -a send.txt -f -i -r 1000 -p 1

This will read command options containing a list of packets from the file send.txt (containing a bunch of -s xx xx xx xx lines, for example).  It will send these packets one after another at a rate of 1000 packets per second.  It will print out the last packet received once per second, letting you know the actual transmit and receive rates.
